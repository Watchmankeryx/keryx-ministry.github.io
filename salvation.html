                    <li><strong>YOU ARE SAVED</strong> - Romans 10:13: "Whoever calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved"</li>

                    <li><strong>YOU HAVE ETERNAL LIFE</strong> - John 3:16, John 5:24: You will live forever with God</li>
                    <li><strong>YOU WILL NEVER LOSE YOUR SALVATION</strong> - John 10:28-29: Nothing can separate you from God's love</li>

                <h3>📖 WHAT TO DO NEXT:</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>TELL SOMEONE</strong> - Romans 10:10 says "with the mouth confession is made unto salvation." Share your decision with a friend or family member today.</li>
                    <li><strong>GET A BIBLE</strong> - Start reading the Gospel of John. Download a free Bible app like YouVersion or Blue Letter Bible.</li>
                    <li><strong>FIND A CHURCH</strong> - Look for a Bible-believing, Christ-centered church in your area. Get baptized as an act of obedience (Matthew 28:19-20).</li>
                    <li><strong>PRAY DAILY</strong> - Talk to God regularly. He's now your Father, not just your Creator. Prayer is simply conversation with God.</li>
                    <li><strong>GROW IN FAITH</strong> - Read Scripture daily, fellowship with other believers, and share the Gospel with others.</li>
                </ol>

                <h2>🛡️ ASSURANCE OF SALVATION</h2>
                
                <div class="assurance-box">
                    <h3>Can I lose my salvation?</h3>
                    <p><strong>No.</strong> Jesus said: "I give them eternal life, and they shall never perish; neither shall anyone snatch them out of My hand" (John 10:28). Once you're saved, you're saved forever. God keeps you, not you keeping yourself.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="assurance-box">
                    <h3>What if I sin after being saved?</h3>
                    <p>1 John 1:9: "If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness." Believers still sin, but we confess and God forgives. Sin doesn't cancel salvation—it damages fellowship with God, which is restored through confession.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="assurance-box">
                    <h3>How can I know for sure I'm saved?</h3>
                    <p>1 John 5:13: "These things I have written to you who believe in the name of the Son of God, that you may KNOW that you have eternal life." God wants you to have assurance! If you genuinely believed in Jesus Christ and received Him as Lord, you ARE saved. Period.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="assurance-box">
                    <h3>I don't feel different. Am I really saved?</h3>
                    <p>Salvation is based on FACT (God's promise), not FEELING. Your emotions may or may not change immediately, but God's Word never changes. Romans 10:13 promises: "Whoever calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved." If you called, you ARE saved—regardless of how you feel.</p>

            <div class="warning-box">
                <h3>⚠️ WHAT IF I REJECT CHRIST?</h3>
                <p>If you reject Jesus Christ as your Savior, you remain under the penalty of sin: eternal death. You will face the tribulation period, the mark of the beast system, and ultimately eternal judgment in the lake of fire.</p>

                <p><strong>Please don't reject the only hope you have.</strong> There is no other way to heaven except through Jesus Christ (John 14:6). Technology won't save you. Good works won't save you. Religion won't save you. Only Christ can save you.</p>
