## About KERYX Ministry

KERYX (Ancient Greek: Κηρυξ) means "Herald"—one who proclaims urgent truth to the nations.

In 2025, we stand at the threshold of the end times. The technology to implement Revelation 13's mark of the beast is operational. The infrastructure for global control is being built. Yet most people—even believers—are completely unaware.

**KERYX Ministry exists to:**
- ✓ Warn the nations about end-times technology
- ✓ Proclaim the Gospel of Jesus Christ
- ✓ Call believers to be watchmen
- ✓ Point people to salvation before the rapture

## What We Believe

- **The rapture could happen at any moment**
- **Every soul matters**
- **Truth must be proclaimed boldly and lovingly**
- **God's Word is infallible and prophetically accurate**

## Key Message

The mark of the beast system described in Revelation 13:16-18 is no longer mysterious or distant. In 2025:

- Brain-computer interfaces connecting humans to AI are operational
- Neural implants are being placed exactly where Revelation prophesied (forehead)
- The infrastructure for global digital control is being built
- People are being conditioned to depend on AI instead of God
- The False Prophet's "image that speaks" parallels AI consciousness

**But there is HOPE:** Jesus Christ offers salvation and escape through the rapture for all who believe.
